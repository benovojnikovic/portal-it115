       <p>This is a page including some information about Beno Vojnikovic. He is the best man who was ever born</p>
       
       <p>Watch this video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkUJv6wz0RI" target="_blank">Gigachad can you feel my heart 1 hour loop.</a> It is Beno's favorite video ever made. Every morning, he wakes up to this song and drinks 15 raw eggs at once for the protein in them. </p>
       
       <p>To the left, you'll see a character from one of Beno's favorite video games, <b>Deltarune</b>. The character is named Ralsei, and he is a nice guy.</p>
       
       <p>Beno's career high of points in a single competitive oragnized basketball game was 30. He was in the eighth grade and was playing against the Timberwolves from the Jackson High School feeder team. They still lost the game, but he had learned valuable lessons from then.</p>
           
      <p>He is planning to become the most recognizable man in the United States of America. Furthermore, when achieved, he will try to become the most recognized man in the entire world. He can be heard saying, "Once everyone in India knows who you are, it's GG."</p>
